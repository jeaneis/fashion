description	The vivid tulip print on Marc by Marc Jacobs' cotton top appeared on several looks at the fall show. We love how this elegant piece has been fitted with a zip fastening along the back - it prevents the slim turtleneck from drooping. Mirror the runway styling with a dark pencil skirt. Shown here with: Fendi cuff, Givenchy bracelet, Maison Martin Margiela rings and ring, Victoria Beckham skirt, Christian Louboutin shoes, Jil Sander clutch.
