description	By Malene Birger's cobalt pants are a key look from the runway. Woven from a lustrous silk and cotton-blend, this high-waisted pair is ideal for evening but won't look out of place in the boardroom. Mirror the catwalk and team it with the matching jacket, breaking up the bold palette with a printed blouse. Shown here with: Peter Pilotto top, Eddie Borgo bracelet, Bottega Veneta rings, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Alexander Wang bag.
