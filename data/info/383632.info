description	Mary Katrantzou's silk dress is printed with the same hyper-real landscape scenes that took center stage at her latest show. Black panels are precision-placed at the waist and skirt to flatter the figure. We love the mood-boosting rainbow shooting across the shoulder. Shown here with: Bottega Veneta bracelet and rings, Aquazzura shoes, Maison Martin Margiela bag.
