description	Tap the season's mod mood with Versace's stretch-cady shift dress. The geometric insert doesn't just provide a bold contrast, it's carefully placed to slim your silhouette and nip in your waist. We love how the gold zip pulls are engraved with the label's signature Medusa head, too. Shown here with: Maiyet cuff, Dominic Jones ring, Givenchy shoes, Stella McCartney clutch.
