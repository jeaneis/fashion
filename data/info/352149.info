description	For SS13, Loewe's Stuart Vevers took inspiration from Salvador Dalí's wife and muse Gala. The bright hue of this 'Flamenco 20' bag is a tribute to the yellow helichrysums that scattered her garden. Crafted from luxuriously soft leather, this updated archive style will add a chic burst of color to every look. Shown here with: Dolce & Gabbana dress and bracelet, Maiyet bracelet, Aurélie Bidermann ring, Gianvito Rossi shoes.
