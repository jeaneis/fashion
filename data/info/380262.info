description	Donna Karan worked with Opening Ceremony designers Humberto Leon and Carol Lim to create this wool-blend herringbone sweater. Inspired by DKNY's nineties designs, the rounded bomber shape was pulled from sporty archive pieces. The coolest part? Spongy neoprene panels which give this piece a distinctly modern feel. Shown here with: Eddie Borgo bracelet, Maria Black ring, Theory skirt, Isabel Marant boots, Alexander Wang bag.
