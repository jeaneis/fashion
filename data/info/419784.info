description	Parisian brand Maje is on every cool girl's radar. This cropped ribbed-knit sweater is cut longer at the back for a flattering fit and will look best layered over a tonal top. We love the pretty pointelle detail, too. Shown here with: J Crew top, Fendi cuff, Pamela Love ring, Frame Denim jeans, Pierre Hardy boots, Maison Martin Margiela bag.
