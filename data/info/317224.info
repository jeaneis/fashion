description	Gloves played a starring role on this season's runways, where no coat, dress or cape was complete without a complementing pair. We love Alaïa's butter-soft black leather set, with discreet snap fastenings that nod to the label's thoughtful, elegant approach to design. Wear yours with a classic coverup for a chic way to keep out the cold. Shown here with: Belstaff coat, Antonio Berardi top, Alexander McQueen skirt and boots, Proenza Schouler bag.
