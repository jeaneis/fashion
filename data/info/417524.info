description	This season, legendary manicurist Jin Soon Choi collaborates with Amy Smilovic on a collection of limited edition nail polishes. Inspired by a textured silver fabric used in Tibi's fall collection, this dark-gray formula is filled with tiny mica and chromatic particles that change color in the light - think of it as a fresh take on glitter varnishes.
