description	New York label Adam Lippes' sophisticated, easy-to-wear pieces are a favorite with style setters from Clémence Poésy to Keira Knightley. We love the relaxed silhouette of this soft cashmere sweater. Cut longer at the back for a flattering finish, this oversized piece will look great with a leather pencil skirt. Shown here with: Bottega Veneta bracelets, Lanvin skirt, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Jil Sander bag.
