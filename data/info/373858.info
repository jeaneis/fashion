description	Make an entrance in Balmain's glittering black and gold jacket. Precision-cut from mid-weight jacquard, this slightly oversized design features the label's signature padded shoulders. We love cinching it at the double-breasted waist with a wide belt - it accentuates the standout silhouette. Shown here with: Oscar de la Renta earrings, Hervé Léger belt, Frame Denim pants, Roland Mouret boots, Giuseppe Zanotti bag.
