description	From the soldiers of the First World War to Catherine Deneuve on a rainy English day in 1964, the trench coat has enjoyed a unique fashion evolution. Historian and journalist Nick Foulkes explores the history, mythology and high-fashion credentials of this iconic garment, which "evolved out of utility and practicality". Inspiring images of screen goddesses Sophia Loren and Audrey Hepburn - as well as war photography and portraits of the British Royal Family - illustrate Foulkes' informative and engrossing work.
