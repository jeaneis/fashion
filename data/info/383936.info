description	Dolce & Gabbana's ruby dress is one of only six in the world. This runway style has been hand-embellished with faceted resin crystals designed to reflect light and create the illusion of lava. Sitting on a bed of super fine tulle, and backed with delicate black chiffon, it's an incredible feat of craftsmanship. Other sizes available. Contact Customer Care for more information. Shown here with: Carolina Bucci earrings, Bottega Veneta ring and clutch, Jimmy Choo shoes.
