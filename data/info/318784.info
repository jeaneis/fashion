description	When Norman Mailer first published his biography of Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn, in 1973, it was a sell-out sensation. Now, on the 50th anniversary of the iconic actress's death, Mailer's collaborator Lawrence Schiller and publishing house Taschen have combined his words with stunning Vogue images taken by Bert Stern, one of America's foremost portrait photographers. Ambitious in both scope and size, this hardcover collector's edition is signed by Stern and displayed in an elegant presentation box. It will make an unmissable centerpiece to any coffee table collection and is an absolute must for fans of the eternally glamorous yet tragic Hollywood star.
