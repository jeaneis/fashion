description	Hussein Chalayan brings his conceptual eye to tailoring with this wool-blend jacket. Designed with long lapels that wrap across the front, this structured coverup features sharp pleats for added dimension. We like the directional dark-green hue â€“ it's a nice departure from predictable black. Shown here with: Burberry Brit top, Fendi bracelet, Maison Martin Margiela rings, Acne pants, Givenchy shoes, Rochas clutch.
