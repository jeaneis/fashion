description	CLU's midnight-blue sweatpants are crafted in the USA from soft cotton-jersey with a relaxed drawstring waist. A great alternative to jeans, we think this dropped-crotch style will work especially well with a biker jacket and heels. Shown here with: IRO jacket, Alexander Wang top, Monica Vinader bracelet, Maria Rudman bracelet, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Alexander Wang bag.
