description	Joya's classic Composition No.1 evokes the warm, exotic parfum of a souk. Blended with top notes of citrus-fresh Mandarin and Orange, the fragrance gently fades into floral Heliotrope and the musky dry down of Tonka Beans and creamy Sandalwood. Store the convenient roll-on bottle in your travel tote for an on-the-go scent refresh.
