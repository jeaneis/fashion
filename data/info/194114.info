description	"A Parisian to his fingertips", couturier Paul Poiret is credited with revolutionizing women's fashion and freeing it from the restrictions of the corset. Historian François Baudot documents the designer, who was a contemporary of Stravinsky, Picasso and Diaghilev, and whose passion for exoticism and orientalism lit up the fashion scene in the early 20th Century. This collectable book is brimming with photographs and illustrations of Poiret's game-changing creations, making it a must-have for fashion history lovers.
