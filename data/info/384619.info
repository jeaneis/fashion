description	Consuelo Castiglioni described Marni's Fall '13 collection as "austere but with a romanticism, it's melancholic, severe". Tailoring played an important part in the designer's vision, and this belted wool and silk-blend twill jacket is an impeccable example. Be inspired by the runway styling and wear it with an A-line skirt. Shown here with: Marni earrings, top, skirt and shoes, Proenza Schouler clutch.
