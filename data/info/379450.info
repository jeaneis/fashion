description	For Fall '13, Christopher Bailey took classic Burberry Prorsum silhouettes and gave them a rebellious twist - think trench coats with metal hardware and sheer latex pencil skirts. This plum jacket is made from high-glossed leather and mimics the textural appearance of crocodile. Cropped at the waist, we think this runway piece looks best with a fitted dress. Shown here with: Burberry Prorsum dress, Maison Martin Margiela ring, Aquazzura shoes, Giuseppe Zanotti bag.
