description	Medieval tapestries, folkloric paisleys and heroines such as Joan of Arc were references for Suno's Fall '13 collection. The floral embroidery of this wool sweater nods to the theme. It's the perfect weight to be worn alone between the seasons, but could easily be layered in cooler months. Shown here with: Bottega Veneta bracelets, Maria Black ring, Pamela Love ring, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi skirt, Givenchy boots, Valentino clutch.
