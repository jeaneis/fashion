description	Dolce & Gabbana's ethereal silk-blend organza dress is finished with a luminous sheen. Sand stretch-silk lining provides coverage under the delicately embroidered cutouts. This loosely tailored design was styled with a crown on the runway, but it looks just as heavenly with an embellished headband and drop earrings. Shown here with: Dolce & Gabbana earrings, Bottega Veneta ring, Givenchy shoes, Charlotte Olympia clutch.
