description	The weight of Saloni's printed wool jumpsuit makes it ideal for fall. We love how the fitted waist draws the eye to the narrowest point of your silhouette. Roll up the cuffs and wear a statement cuff as your sole accessory. Shown here with: Eddie Borgo cuff, Maria Black ring, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Valentino clutch.
