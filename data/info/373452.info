description	Sole measures approximately 20mm/ 1 inch. Creepers were first a hit with Teddy Boys in the fifties - now they're making a comeback as one of the fashion set's must-have shoe styles. Crafted in France from supple black leather, Robert Clergerie's pair has a surprisingly lightweight rubber sole. Pick out the white stitching with a monochrome T-shirt. Shown here with: LPD New York top, Fendi bracelet, Alexander McQueen skirt, McQ Alexander McQueen bag.
