description	Erdem Moralioglu's fantasy florals took a darker turn for fall. In this satin-lined leather top, pretty pale-pink and purple blooms are distorted with a polka-dot print. We love the on-trend oversized cut, perfect for pairing with a pencil skirt as seen on the runway. Shown here with: Alexander McQueen bracelet, Bottega Veneta bracelets, Erdem skirt, Reed Krakoff shoes, Jil Sander clutch.
