description	Chic outerwear is as important as ever for fall. Gucci's thick bouclé wool-blend coat is a beautiful pick - the long, tailored shape has a slimming effect. We especially love the nipped-in waist - mirror the runway with tight knee boots and a ladylike tote. Shown here with: Marni top, Chloé cuff, Maison Martin Margiela rings, Lanvin skirt, Jimmy Choo boots, Fendi bag.
