description	Take a playful approach to color-blocking with Markus Lupfer's lightweight merino wool sweater. We love how the glittering sequined brush seems to paint the hem a brilliant shade of blue. Slip yours on with jeans or take the artistic route with a red skirt. Shown here with: Eddie Borgo bracelet, Bottega Veneta rings, Helmut Lang skirt, Jimmy Choo shoes, Marc by Marc Jacobs iPad case.
