description	The dropped armholes on OAK's effortless jersey tank make this style ideal for layering. We love the long, asymmetric hem - it stamps this otherwise basic tee with downtown edge. Finish the look with a bra top, distressed jeans and buckled boots. Shown here with: Anndra Neen cuff, Kenneth Jay Lane rings, Pamela Love ring, Current/Elliott jeans, Toga boots, Jimmy Choo bag.
