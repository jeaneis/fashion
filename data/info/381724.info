description	Adorned with gold buttons, Marc by Marc Jacobs' coat has a strong military feel - even the deep blue shade is aptly named 'General Navy'. The wool-blend fabric is soft and warm, and it's the ideal medium weight for transitioning from fall to winter. Wear this runway style with a crisp shift dress and ankle boots. Shown here with: Miu Miu dress, Aur√©lie Bidermann cuff, Maiyet rings, Gucci boots, Jil Sander clutch.
