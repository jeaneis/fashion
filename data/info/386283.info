description	Vionnet's asymmetric stretch-silk dress is one of our favorite styles from the label's Fall '13 runway collection. We love how the extended ivory crepe skirt balances the single sleeve for perfect proportions. This beautiful design deserves to be in full focus, so wear yours with simple accessories. Shown here with: Lydia Courteille ring, Gianvito Rossi boots, Valentino clutch.
