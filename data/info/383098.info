description	Proenza Schouler's mid-weight sweater is knitted in a collage of varied constructions - a well-executed detail we love. The top portion is ribbed with dimensional wales, while the lower panel features a basketweave design. Plush and full of texture, this wool, cashmere and silk-blend style is wonderfully soft, too. Shown here with: Fendi bracelet, Bottega Veneta rings, Maria Black ring, Altuzarra skirt, Alexander Wang shoes, Proenza Schouler clutch.
