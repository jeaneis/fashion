description	Malene Birger believes that, "you have to wear and express the clothes and not the opposite." This pretty lace-trimmed silk-chiffon gown is perfectly in line with the designer's effortless approach to style. We especially love the sateen-jersey lining - it anchors the airy pleated skirt. Shown here with: Ashley Pittman bracelets, Maiyet ring, Brian Atwood shoes, Charlotte Olympia clutch.
