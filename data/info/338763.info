description	Inspired by historic collaborations between Chanel, Cocteau, Dal√≠ and Schiaparelli respectively, the celebratory 'Fashion and Art Collusion: Britain Creates' project has been established by the BFC/Bazaar Fashion Arts Foundation in conjunction with London's 2012 Festival. Harnessing the talents of Mary Katrantzou, Mark Titchner, Peter Pilotto and Francis Upritchard to name just some of the creatives involved, nine duos have produced sculpture, garments and audio - captured as part of this stunning boxset. As well as two photographic books, this pack includes a DVD of Hussein Chalayan and Gavin Turk's work 'Four Minute Mile' and nine commemorative posters.
