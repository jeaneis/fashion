description	The curving bands on Dagmar's jacquard-knit 'Jenat' pencil skirt aren't just a graphic flourish - they work to slim and streamline your hips and legs. We love the zipped side slits, too. They can be unfastened to adjust the fit and look of this design. Shown here with: Helmut Lang top, Eddie Borgo bracelet, Bottega Veneta rings, Maison Martin Margiela boots, Alexander Wang bag.
