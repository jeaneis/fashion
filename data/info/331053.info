description	Dazzling with 2.05-carats of diamonds, Artisan's 14-karat gold-plated bracelet is stunning in its simplicity. We love the label's acute attention to detail, as seen in the contrasting and artfully crafted, irregular sterling silver setting. For an elegant way to accessorize your look wear this special style solo, or alternatively layer it with similar pieces to maximize the impact.
