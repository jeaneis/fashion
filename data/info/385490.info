description	Stella McCartney's sweater uses color blocking to flattering effect. The wool-blend is thick enough to be cozy but not too bulky for layering. We think this piece looks perfect worn with slim-fit pants and pumps. Shown here with: Fendi bracelet, Stella McCartney pants, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Jil Sander clutch.
