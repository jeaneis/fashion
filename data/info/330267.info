description	Sophia Kokosalaki's stretch-crepe gown is perfect for your special day. The pleated skirt is longer through the back to create beautiful movement as you walk down the aisle, and we love the elegant strap across the back that draws in the waist. A stunning choice for a modern bride. Shown here with: Tom Binns earrings, Jimmy Choo shoes, Lanvin bag.
