description	With grainy films as inspiration, Preen by Thornton Bregazzi crafts this satin skirt in a dabbled leopard print. This smooth style has a structured feel and we especially love the zipped pockets - it gives the design punk appeal. Mirror the runway styling with the matching top. Shown here with: Maison Martin Margiela cuff, Bottega Veneta rings, Maria Black ring, Aquazzura shoes, Fendi bag.
