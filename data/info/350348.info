description	Emilio Pucci's kimono-style jacket is right in line with the Italian label's commitment to craftsmanship. From the sturdy yet soft cotton-canvas to the richly detailed embroidery, every aspect of this piece has been carefully considered. Our favorite accent is the crane design hidden on the inside - it makes this runway style feel truly luxurious inside and out. Shown here with: Sophia Kokosalaki earrings, Vanessa Bruno top, Alexander Wang shorts, Alexander McQueen shoes, Kotur clutch.
