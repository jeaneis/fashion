description	J.Crew's off-white silk 'Carenna' gown is detailed with dots that are designed to look like a spray of "cotton confetti". We love how the layers of mesh lining create volume in the floor-sweeping skirt. Style it with a transparent box clutch and metallic heels for the most modern bridal look. Shown here with: Kenneth Jay Lane earrings, Anndra Neen cuff, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, Charlotte Olympia clutch.
