description	Elevate understated looks with DELPOZO's embellished gilet. Black sequins and gold leaves take this lightweight style from simple to standout. This piece was styled with a bright jacket on the runway, but we think it looks just as chic over head-to-toe neutrals. Shown here with: Acne top, Chlo√© ring and clutch, The Row pants, Givenchy shoes.
