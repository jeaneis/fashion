description	Vanessa Bruno uses raw-edged off-white trims to give this demure silk-satin dress a deconstructed edge. We especially love the chiffon panels - it lends this fully lined piece graceful movement. Wear yours with cutout ankle boots. Shown here with: Bottega Veneta bracelets and rings, Gianvito Rossi boots, Miu Miu clutch.
