German photographer Anna Bauer uses a large-format camera and Polaroids to capture scenes after the shows in Paris, Milan, London and New York. Published by the acclaimed Angelika Books with art direction by Fabien Baron, this hardback who's who of the fashion world looks as beautiful as the subjects within its elegantly bound pages.
