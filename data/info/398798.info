description	Bold without being overpowering, feminine but not overtly floral, By Killian's Good Girl Gone Bad perfume combines Rose of May, Jasmine and Indian Tuberose with musky Cedarwood and Amber. We love the way it lingers, not to mention the glossy white clutch it's housed in - an Art Deco-influenced creation inspired by cigarette cases of that era.
