description	Tomas Maier took inspiration from the frescoes of Tiepolo and Veronese for Bottega Veneta's CR13 collection. Embellished with black studs and a mesh overlay, this stretch-silk dress marries a flattering modern silhouette with intricate Old World-inspired detailing. The artful floral print deserves full focus - play it up with lemon pumps and simple jewelry. Large to size. See Size & Fit tab. Shown here with: Bottega Veneta earrings and shoes, Alex Monroe bracelet, Maiyet bracelet, Monica Vinader rings, Kotur clutch.
