description	Peter Pilotto's striking runway prints were inspired by the work of Spanish Renaissance artists. This strong-shouldered crepe dress is spliced with bold color-block panels deliberately placed to define the silhouette and slim your waist. The split front puts your legs in the spotlight, so heels are a must. Shown here with: Marc by Marc Jacobs cuff and ring, Versus boots, Bottega Veneta clutch.
