description	Erdem Moralioglu is loved for his floral prints, but for this silk-organza skirt he creates the signature blooms with delicate crystals and paillettes. Layered for subtle volume that won't overwhelm petite frames, this silk satin-lined style will look beautiful against a structured top. Shown here with: Roland Mouret top, Alexander McQueen ring, Fendi shoes, Jil Sander clutch.
