description	Heel measures approximately 50mm/ 2 inches. Leave it to Karl Lagerfeld to make biker boots even more covetable. The high-shine silver leather puts a futuristic spin on the tough-girl staple. We especially love the durable black rubber sole - it provides traction and stability during inclement weather. Wear yours with a metallic coat and a fitted skirt. Shown here with: Duvetica coat, Alexander McQueen top, Bottega Veneta rings, T by Alexander Wang skirt, Alexander Wang bag.
