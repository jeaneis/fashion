description	The heron print sweeping across ALICE by Temperley's jumpsuit is inspired by Japanese folk stories and has been specially created in-house. The beauty of this lightweight silk style is that it will work day or night - we love the shoulder-baring slit sleeves and silhouette-shaping belt. Shown here with: Chloé earrings, Eddie Borgo cuff, Hervé Van der Straeten bracelet, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, Anya Hindmarch clutch.
