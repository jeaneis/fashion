description	Part of the 'Paperdolls' collection, Yummie Tummie's paper-light 'Devina' slip is imperceptible beneath your clothes. Underwired cups and adjustable straps negate the need for a bra. The bonded seams help to ensure a super smooth finish, and the silicone strips prevent it from riding up, too.
