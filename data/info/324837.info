description	Inspired by her jetset lifestyle, former fashion journalist Anna Laub names every Prism design after a cosmopolitan city, and we love these 'Sao Paulo' optical glasses. Punctuated by black matte-acetate and a flash of brushed-copper metal, these handmade spectacles are a smart investment. Complement the contemporary craftsmanship with sharp tailoring for the most modern take.
