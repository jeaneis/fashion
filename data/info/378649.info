description	Knitted from downy cashmere and cotton, Alexander Wang's flecked sweater is a cozy pick for fall. We love the slightly cropped fit - it's a flattering length to wear with high-rise skirts and skinny jeans. Shown here with: T by Alexander Wang jacket and skirt, Maria Black ring, Bottega Veneta rings, Tabitha Simmons boots, Maison Martin Margiela clutch.
