description	The draped bodice on Lanvin's plaid wool-blend dress has a stiff feel that retains its shape. We love how the peplum falls to one side, creating subtle volume that won't overwhelm even petite frames. This runway style also has a raw hem - a smart detail that makes tailoring a breeze. Shown here with: Lanvin necklace and ring, Chlo√© cuff, Fendi shoes, Bottega Veneta clutch.
