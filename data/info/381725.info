description	Loosely tailored outerwear was key at Marc by Marc Jacobs' fall runway show. Hitting just below the knee, this oversized 'Rex' coat is made from a super soft wool-blend. We especially love the rich merlot hue - it's a nice alternative to traditional black or navy. Shown here with: Maria Black earring, Marc by Marc Jacobs dress and ring, Fendi cuff, Jimmy Choo boots, M2Malletier clutch.
