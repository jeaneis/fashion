description	EXCLUSIVE TO NET-A-PORTER.COM. The sculptural shapes of Esteban Cortazar's fall collection are inspired by the manta ray, and the designer's appreciation of the "angles, curves and lines" of the female form. The leather detail of these black stretch-cady shorts sits slightly away from the body. A simple top is the best way to maximize this unique silhouette. Shown here with: Calvin Klein Collection top, Esteban Cortazar cuff, Kenneth Jay Lane rings, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Maison Martin Margiela clutch.
