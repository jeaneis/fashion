color	Gray
description	The leather of Rick Owens' biker jacket is so soft and supple, it feels like you've had it for years. We like the dark-gray shade as an alternative to basic black - it has soft green undertones that reveal just the slightest whisper of color. Keep it effortless with a draped maxi dress and boots. Shown here with: Rick Owens dress, Base Range dress, Eddie Borgo bracelet, Maison Martin Margiela boots, Alexander Wang bag.
