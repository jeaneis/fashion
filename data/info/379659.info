description	We loved the neutral tones on Temperley London's Fall '13 runway. This silk-lined cream dress is crafted from a mid-weight blend of wool and cashmere and scattered with glittering crystals. The back is embellishment-free, so it won't snag on layers and is comfortable to wear at seated dinner events. Shown here with: Lulu Frost earrings, Tabitha Simmons shoes, Stella McCartney bag.
