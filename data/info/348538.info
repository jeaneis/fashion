description	Perfumed oils have been used since ancient times but Joya's iteration is thoroughly modern and refined. Housed in a lovingly hand-crafted porcelain jar, this sparkling Orange parfum glides on to the skin and unfolds to reveal subtle notes of Jasmine, Sandalwood and earthy Tonka Bean - use the 22-karat gold dipped wand, or gently rub into pulse points for all-day scent.
