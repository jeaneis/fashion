description	Traditional fragrances are designed strictly for the body - mist it on your hair and you end up with dry, crunchy locks.

Infused with nourishing Aloe Vera and Jojoba, this decadent scent envelops you in a warm cloud of Ylang Ylang and Amber while gently nourishing and softening each strand.
