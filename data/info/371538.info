description	"She likes to collage textures and color," Carven's Guillaume Henry said of his new season muse. Featuring a clash of photo-prints and geode formation imagery, this eye-catching A-line skirt is finished with slit pockets - a practical detail we love. Keep things simple and ladylike with a white jacket and sand pumps. Shown here with: Nina Ricci jacket, Eddie Borgo cuff, Christian Louboutin shoes, M2Malletier clutch.
