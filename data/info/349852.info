description	Made in the U.S.A. from Italian vintage-inspired fabric, Lisa Marie Fernandez's swimsuit is an eye-catching swimwear choice. We love how the high neck is balanced by the scoop back, while the scuba-inspired zip adds sporty appeal. This color-block design doubles as a bodysuit, so team yours with high-waisted jeans.
