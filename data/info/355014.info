description	Contrasting navy with cream silk-chiffon, By Malene Birger's airy 'Kadria' gown was designed for warm summer evenings. We love how the plunging neckline is tempered by a discreet lace-trimmed slip - it's an elegant way to champion this season's lingerie trend. Shown here with: Ashley Pittman bracelets, Maiyet ring, Jimmy Choo shoes, Charlotte Olympia clutch.
