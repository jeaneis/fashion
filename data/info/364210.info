description	Temperley London's diaphanous dress balances weightless silk-organza with thick bands of lace. The delicately pleated and tiered skirt is gathered at the waist to create subtle, airy volume. We love the warm cream hue, too - it flatters every skin tone. Shown here with: Bijoux Heart earrings, Monica Vinader rings, Jimmy Choo shoes, Charlotte Olympia clutch.
