description	Military-inspired details are always chic, but we particularly like Skaist-Taylor's discreet take on the look. This crepe playsuit is finished with epaulettes and engraved gold buttons - a subtle nod to traditional officers' jackets. Wear yours in lieu of a LBD after dark, styling it with heels and a clutch. Shown here with: Maison Martin Margiela cuff, Bottega Veneta rings, Aquazzura shoes, Marni clutch.
