description	For Bottega Veneta's fall collection, Tomas Maier took an architectural approach to ladylike dressing. Instead of lying flat, each of the pleats on this wool-blend flannel midi skirt projects outwards for a three-dimensional effect. Mirror the runway with a trim black sweater. Shown here with: Bottega Veneta top, Oscar de la Renta bracelets, Esteban Cortazar ring, Fendi shoes, Lanvin clutch.
