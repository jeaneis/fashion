description	Crafted with a touch of silk for an exceptionally soft finish, Rick Owens' taupe jersey dress is versatile enough to be worn year-round. We love how the fitted, ribbed sleeves balance the fluid silhouette - wear yours with flat sandals or style it as a tunic over leather leggings. Shown here with: Aur√©lie Bidermann ring, Maison Martin Margiela ring, Rick Owens shoes, Alexander Wang bag.
