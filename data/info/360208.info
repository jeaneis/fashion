description	Dagmar's sporty stretch-crepe jersey top is finished with soft and spongy quilted panels - it's a clever detail that adds dimension to this slim-fitting piece.

Shown here with: Bottega Veneta bracelets, Kenneth Jay Lane ring, Pamela Love ring, Theory skirt, Jimmy Choo shoes, Maison Martin Margiela clutch.
