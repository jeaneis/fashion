description	A loosely tailored shape makes Marni's wool-blend coat a classic choice for fall. Trimmed with goat hair and nutria, this piece was styled on the runway with a printed dress and skinny belt - we think it looks just as chic over pants. Shown here with: Mary Katrantzou dress, Maiyet ring, Marni ring, Marni belt, Lanvin boots and bag.
