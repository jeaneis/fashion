name	Wool-tweed peplum skirt
price	$1,295

description	As fall ushers in a more ladylike mood, the skirt is firmly back in the spotlight. Michael Kors' take sees the New York designer revamp classic wool-tweed - halving its weight and cutting it in a sharp, peplum-pencil silhouette. Carefully considered splits and satin lining ensure this piece moves beautifully. Shown here with: Equipment top, Fendi bracelet and bag, Kenneth Jay Lane rings, Maria Black ring, Michael Kors shoes.
