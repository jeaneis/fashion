description	Fuller, longer, more voluminous lashes are just a stroke away with Ellis Faas' versatile mascara. The slim, pointed brush lifts and separates, while the creamy pitch-black formula glides on smoothly and evenly. One sweep creates a natural, wide-eyed look while two or more coats offer a glamorous finish worthy of any red carpet - or important date.
