description	Inspired by the saturated hues of mid '90s designs, Prabal Gurung creates this colorful silk crepe de chine shirt. The flower print is graphic, not girlish, and the dipped back hem makes it easy to create a half tucked-in look. Keep yours in focus with black skirt. Shown here with: Miu Miu skirt, Bottega Veneta bracelets, Eddie Borgo bracelet and cuff, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Rochas clutch.
