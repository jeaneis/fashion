description	Rick Owens is famous for loose, relaxed silhouettes. The designer adds subtle definition to this slightly boxy off-white sweater with long, fitted sleeves. We love how luxurious the alpaca-blend feels against the skin - it makes this wonderfully versatile style even more covetable. Shown here with: Rick Owens shorts, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Jil Sander clutch.
