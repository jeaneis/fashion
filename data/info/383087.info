description	Proenza Schouler cleanses last season's kaleidoscopic palettes with optic whites for fall. "We feel a little grown-up now," says designer Lazaro Hernandez of the sophisticated direction. In a boxy '60s shape, this sheath dress features heavyweight bouclé bonded to spongy jersey. Keep it directional with patent heels. Shown here with: Kenneth Jay Lane earrings, Maison Martin Margiela cuff, Bottega Veneta rings, Maria Black ring, Reed Krakoff shoes, Joseph bag.
