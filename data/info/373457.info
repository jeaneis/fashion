description	Joseph is all about creating timeless outerwear that will work season after season. We love the label's modern take on the cape - sleek lapels and a single button fastening give this black wool-blend felt piece a menswear-inspired feel. The length is perfect for teaming with tailored pants, skirts and dresses. Shown here with: Vionnet top, Gucci gloves, Stella McCartney pants, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Marni clutch.
