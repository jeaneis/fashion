description	Traditional nail polish removers use harmful acetone and acetate to literally strip the nail of color. RGB takes a gentler approach with their individually packaged soy-based, 100% cotton pads. Use just one of these non-hazardous and non-flammable wipes to effectively take off polish on all ten fingers.
