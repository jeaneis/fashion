description	Infused with cooling Menthol, Hampton Sun's soothing oil-free mist is enriched with calming Aloe Vera that acts as an anti-inflammatory to aching sunburns. Evenly spray over areas that have been exposed to UVA and UVB rays. We also love it spritzed after a morning shower - the most refreshing start to the day.
