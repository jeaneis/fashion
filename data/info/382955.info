description	Look closely at Brooke Gregson's brushed 14-karat gold 'Taurus' necklace and you'll see it's designed to emulate the moon's surface. We love how the 0.16-carats of glittering diamonds map out the Taurus constellation. Work a cool layered look by styling yours with a shorter chain. Shown here with: Jennifer Meyer necklace, Miu Miu top.
