description	Bottega Veneta's sterling silver bracelet shone on the label's hit spring runway. It's constructed with geometric cage-effect segments, which are backed in light-catching enameled lucite. This creates the illusion of heavy embellishment without any of the weight, making it easy to wear but super impactful, too. Shown here with: Antonio Berardi dress, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, Bottega Veneta clutch.
