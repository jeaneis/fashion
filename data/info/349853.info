description	Channel 1960s Brigitte Bardot in Lisa Marie Fernandez's retro-inspired 'Poppy' bikini. Supported by flexible boning and a sturdy buckle fastening, this set will stay put during beach activities. We love how the low-rise briefs create the look of an elongated torso. Shown here with: Eddie Borgo bracelet, See by Chlo√© shorts, K Jacques St Tropez shoes, M Missoni bag.
