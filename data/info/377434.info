description	We love the bold color palette and relaxed silhouette of See by Chloé's silk crepe de chine dress. Cut with a subtle keyhole neckline and fluted sleeves, this fully lined style is perfect for parties or weddings, but could easily be dressed down with brogues and a satchel. Shown here with: Chloé cuff, Maison Martin Margiela ring, Lanvin shoes, 3.1 Phillip Lim bag.
