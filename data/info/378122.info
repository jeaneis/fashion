description	Camouflage is one of fall's biggest print stories - Michael Kors puts a typically feminine spin on the motif with this lustrous jacquard dress. The black stretch-crepe back and sides allow you to move freely and sit comfortably - as well as creating the illusion of a tiny waist. Shown here with: Alexander McQueen bracelet, Fendi cuff, Reed Krakoff shoes, Alexander Wang case.
