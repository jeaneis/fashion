description	A spitfire crashed into a grand English drawing room, Agyness Deyn wandering the sand dunes of Namibia, models dwarfed by giant dolls - it could only be the fairy tale-like photography of Tim Walker. This beautiful compendium of the Vogue regular's work showcases the vivid and theatrical imagination that has made his shoots so unique, and features a foreword by singer Kate Bush and an introduction from fashion historian Robin Muir. Interspersed with snippets from Walker's sketchbooks, giving the reader a tantalizing glimpse at the narrative behind his images, this tome is an essential investment for photography and fashion mavens alike.
