description	Kevyn Aucoin believed that one of the most important steps in creating a flawless look was first sculpting and highlighting the face. This small, square-shaped brush has been designed to create instant definition along the sides of the nose and at the eyelids - we suggest loading yours with a contouring powder or cream makeup one to two shades darker than your skin tone for a natural look.
