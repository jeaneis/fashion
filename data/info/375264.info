description	Antonio Berardi's stretch-wool crepe skirt is classically ladylike with an unexpected twist - the asymmetric zip fastening is covered with a peaked front panel.

Shown here with: Haider Ackermann top, Bottega Veneta bracelets, rings and clutch, Kenneth Jay Lane rings, Gianvito Rossi shoes.
