description	Haider Ackermann's Fall '13 runway show was brimming with beautifully tailored pieces like this boiled wool-blend jacket. The signature elongated sleeves unzip to reveal a moss-green satin interior. We loved the nipped-in waist and frayed and distressed detailing. Shown here with: Equipment top, Chan Luu bracelet, Maison Martin Margiela ring and clutch, Haider Ackermann belt and skirt, Christian Louboutin boots.
