description	Referencing 17th century Dutch painters, Valentino's creative directors Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli made ornate collars their focus this season. Artfully adorned with beads, this wool and silk-blend dress showcases cream cutout leather at the neckline and cuffs. We love the slimming effect of its A-line cut. Shown here with: Lanvin ring, Valentino shoes and clutch.
