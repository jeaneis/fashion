description	Impeccably cut from a lustrous silk-blend and fully lined for a smooth fit, Carven's zebra-striped camisole is a sophisticated way to work eye-catching pattern. We love how the print pops against plain pants, but the coolest way to wear it is with the matching skirt as seen on the runway. Shown here with: Fendi bracelet, Miu Miu pants, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Rochas clutch.
