description	Joseph's signature 'Laurent' blazer comes this season in a wow-worthy fuchsia stretch-crepe. Impeccably tailored, it's fluid but still structured and proportioned for a menswear-inspired silhouette. We say work the top-to-toe look with the matching pants. Shown here with: T by Alexander Wang top, Maison Martin Margiela ring, Givenchy shoes, Sophie Hulme clutch.
