description	Mary Katrantzou is loved for her spectacular prints but this season the designer puts a sharp focus on silhouette. This metallic jacquard dress features an intricately woven tree motif and an even more striking shape - the strong shoulders and full skirt play up a minuscule waist. Keep this silk-lined piece in focus with a simple clutch and sandals. Shown here with: Tom Binns earrings, Valentino bracelet, Maria Black ring, Givenchy shoes, Kotur clutch.
