description	Notte by Marchesa's supremely elegant navy lace and tulle gown will never date. We love how the scrolling sequin embellishment has been applied to the stretch-crepe de chine lining for a more subtle shimmer. Maximize the beautiful silhouette with heels. Shown here with: Maison Martin Margiela ring and ring, Maiyet ring, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Alexander McQueen clutch.
