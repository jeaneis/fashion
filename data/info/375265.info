description	Antonio Berardi combines two of his signatures - embellishments and precision tailoring - to create this crepe sheath dress. The dense rows of beads and sequins are eye-catching, but it's the clever faux front split and handy slant pockets that set this flattering style apart. Wear yours with a simple bracelet and ankle boots. Shown here with: Eddie Borgo bracelet, Bottega Veneta rings, Gianvito Rossi boots, Nancy Gonzalez clutch.
