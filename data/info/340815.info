description	Scott Schuman's internationally acclaimed blog The Sartorialist is just as likely to feature house painters, cowboys and bartenders as fashionistas, and his second book, 'Closer', celebrates the diversity of subjects that has made his photography so unique. Following his lens from the streets of New York to Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris and beyond, this book documents the intriguing intricacies of how we dress, creating a "rich tapestry of global style" in the process. A must-have for fans of Schuman's work, you are sure to find something new and inspiring each time you open it.
