description	For Donna Karan, New York City is a constant source of inspiration. Designed for an oversized fit, DKNY's airy stretch-silk crepe de chine shirt dress has an effortless, urban appeal. We love that it comes with its own slip - it takes the guesswork out of finding the perfect underpinnings. Shown here with: Maison Martin Margiela cuff, Bottega Veneta rings, Jil Sander shoes, See by Chlo√© clutch.
