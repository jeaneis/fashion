description	Straight from the runway, Carven's coat taps two of this season's biggest trends - oversized silhouettes and a bold bubblegum hue. We love the textured feel of the brushed-felt - slip it over monochrome knitwear for the biggest impact. Shown here with: Equipment top, Maria Black ring, KENZO ring, Miu Miu shorts, Stella McCartney boots, Maison Martin Margiela bag.
