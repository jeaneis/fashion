description	"It's remixing American classicism; about a girl who travels the world, and takes something from every place she goes," said Tory Burch about her spring collection. A colorful mosaic of beads and sequins lends this floaty silk-georgette top global appeal. Reference the runway with citrus-hued shorts and sandals. Shown here with: Ashley Pittman bracelets, DKNY shorts, K Jacques St Tropez shoes, Mulberry bag.
