description	Consuelo Castiglioni took an austere approach to Marni's fall runway collection. Neatly cut from supple dark-green and black leather, this backpack-style bag is strikingly simple. The lightly padded shoulder rest is a thoughtful touch - carry yours against a loose top and jeans. Shown here with: Stella McCartney top, Marc by Marc Jacobs bracelet, Maiyet ring, Current/Elliott jeans, rag & bone boots.
