description	The bright-blue hue of Matthew Williamson's stretch-silk chiffon dress flatters every skin tone. This lightweight, fluid style is intricately pleated and features a hook-fastening shoulder so it's easy to slip on and off. We love the pretty crystal and bead-embellished grosgrain belt. Shown here with: Tom Binns earrings, Pamela Love ring, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, Pierre Hardy clutch.
