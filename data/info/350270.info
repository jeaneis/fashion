description	Kevyn Aucoin believed in the transformative power of makeup and his exceptional tools were designed to make application as effortless as possible. The densely packed, soft bristles of this large brush glide across the skin and the long Lucite handle helps steady the hand - we say take advantage of the size and use yours to dust a layer of powder over your face for a matte finish.
