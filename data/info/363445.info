Each panel on this tapered pair has been cut apart, jumbled and sewn back together in a spiral pattern. The effect is a graphic motif that subtly spells out the brand's name. Shown here with: Proenza Schouler jacket, T by Alexander Wang top, Kenneth Jay Lane rings, Maria Black ring, Alexander Wang shoes, Stella McCartney clutch.
