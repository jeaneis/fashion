description	Emilio Pucci's silk-crepe and net runway dress reveals subtle flashes of skin with cutouts at the waist, shoulders and back. We love the knotted ribbon buttons and weightless sheer silk-chiffon hem - boning along the sides keeps the silhouette super sleek. Shown here with: Emilio Pucci jacket, Maiyet ring, Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, Sophie Hulme clutch.
