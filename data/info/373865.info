description	Balmain's stretch-denim skinny jeans are crafted with a subtle coating. We love how the cuffs can be unzipped to switch up the silhouette. Let the bold red hue take center stage by teaming yours with black separates. Shown here with: Balmain jacket, T by Alexander Wang top, Eddie Borgo cuff, Gianvito Rossi shoes, Versace bag.
