description	"She's creative in the way she mixes things together, she likes texture," said creative director Guillaume Henry of the Carven girl. This sweater is finely knitted from wool and paneled with sheer blue lace. The appliqué reveals a hint of skin near the waistline, so layer it with a camisole for more coverage. Shown here with: Eddie Borgo bracelet, Bottega Veneta rings, Michael van der Ham skirt, Givenchy shoes, Alexander Wang bag.
