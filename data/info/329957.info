description	Bottega Veneta designer Thomas Maier ranks "color, then material, then shape" as his artistic progression. This dress from the CR13 collection is printed in a painterly black and gray palette and smocked from silk-chiffon in a simple shift silhouette. Its neckline is subtly dotted with beads, so no necklace is needed - just add coordinating onyx earrings. Shown here with: Pamela Love earrings, Bottega Veneta cardigan, bracelet, shoes and bag, Alexander McQueen bracelet, Reed Krakoff ring.
