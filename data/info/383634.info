description	Bridges inspired Mary Katrantzou's latest collection, and this wool-blend dress is patterned to look like a lattice of trusses and beams. The fitted bodice flares away from your hips into a pleated skirt - a cut that will flatter any frame. Continue the black and gray palette with monochrome accessories. Shown here with: Fendi bracelet, Alexander McQueen ring, Maria Black ring, Reed Krakoff shoes, Joseph bag.
