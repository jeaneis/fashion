description	Founded by former eveningwear designer Kiana Anvaripour, dMondaine is the go-to for clever lingerie solutions. We love the versatility of this stretch one-shoulder bra - the single strap can be attached in four different ways, making it the ideal foundation to everything from asymmetric dresses to halterneck tops. Wear it with: dMondaine slip.
