description	Cult Italian label Marni is known for its cool, creative aesthetic. We love this twill sweatshirt, printed with contrasting gloss and matte effects. The thick cotton-jersey maximizes the oversized cut - balance it with tailored or skinny pants. Shown here with: Maison Martin Margiela ring, Maiyet ring, Marc Jacobs pants, Marni shoes and bag.
