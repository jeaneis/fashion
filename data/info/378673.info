description	Halston Heritage takes a more abstract approach to color-blocking with this fluid silk-georgette top. The hues are separated by curved lines instead of straight ones - a small detail that gives this piece a sense of ease. Wear yours to the office with a trim skirt, swapping it out for boyfriend jeans at the weekend. Shown here with: Lanvin ring, Victoria Beckham skirt, Givenchy shoes, Bottega Veneta clutch.
