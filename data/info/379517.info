description	Issa's dress is meticulously woven to mimic the look of wicker without any of the stiffness. The pleats create subtle volume while also minimizing the waist. We love the hints of neon-orange - they add a cool twist to the ladylike design. Shown here with: Mulberry bracelet, Ashley Pittman bracelet, Monica Vinader ring, Aquazzura shoes, Jil Sander clutch.
