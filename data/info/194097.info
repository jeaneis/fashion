description	Regarded as the greatest ballet company of the 20th Century, the Ballets Russes introduced unprecedented creativity into the arts, influencing not only ballet and theater, but also fashion, visual arts and interior design. André Tubeuf's extraordinary book offers a rare insight into the company, its director Serge Diaghilev, and collaborations with greats like Igor Stravinsky and Pablo Picasso. Covering the years 1911 to 1914, this is a celebration of one of the most glorious periods in the history of dance.
